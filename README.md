# 🎵 Ranking Taylor Swift Songs Based on Radio Hit Features

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the ranking of Taylor Swift's songs based on their radio hit potential using various linear ordering methods. The study evaluates which musical features have the greatest impact on a song’s popularity on the radio.

##  Analysis Methods
The project utilizes seven linear ordering methods, including:

- **TOPSIS**
- **Hellwig's Method**
- **Zeroed Unitarization (MUZ)**
- **SSW Method**
- **Strahl's Method**
- **Nowak's Method**

Each method was applied to a dataset of Taylor Swift's songs, and the results were compared to assess ranking consistency.

##  Features Analyzed
The ranking was based on **eight musical features**:

###  Stimuli (higher values are better):
- **Danceability** – Measures how suitable a track is for dancing.
- **Energy** – Represents the perceived intensity of a song.
- **Valence** – Indicates how positive the music sounds.
- **Popularity** – Determines how well-known the song is.

###  Detriments (lower values are better):
- **Speechiness** – Detects the presence of spoken words.
- **Liveness** – Identifies live recordings.
- **Duration Difference** – Measures deviation from the ideal length (~3:30).
- **Explicit** – Indicates whether the song contains explicit language.

##  Results
The top-ranked songs across all methods:

1. **Paper Rings**  (Ranked #1 in most cases)
2. **Shake It Off (Taylor's Version)**
3. **ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco)**
4. **New Romantics (Taylor's Version)**

The analysis showed a strong correlation between all methods, but Nowak's method exhibited the greatest discrepancies from the others.

##  Data Sources
The data was obtained from **Spotify Web API** and **academic literature** on linear ordering methods.

##  Key Insights
The findings indicate that certain musical characteristics significantly impact a song’s radio success. **High danceability, positive energy, and the absence of explicit content** increase a song’s chances of becoming a hit.
